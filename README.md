# Tomato_leaf_disease_detection

1. Introduction
In this project, we build a plant leaf disease classification model using Transfer Learning based on the InceptionV3 architecture pretrained on ImageNet. The aim is to classify leaf images into different disease categories or healthy class.

2. Importing Required Libraries
•	TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning
•	ImageDataGenerator for data preprocessing
•	Adam optimizer for model training
•	EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint for model management
•	sklearn for evaluation metrics
•	matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
